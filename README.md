How to Program the PIC16F722 Using Arduino Nano (CH340C)

<img align="right" width="35%" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5362f43-7eec-449f-9652-5d813f59a7e1">

## **Step 1: Understanding the Limitations**
The **PIC16F722** is a PIC microcontroller and **cannot** be programmed directly using the Arduino IDE (which is designed for AVR and ARM-based microcontrollers like the ATmega328 on the Arduino Nano). However, you can use the Arduino Nano as a **PIC programmer** to upload the compiled HEX file to the PIC16F722.

### **Possible Approaches:**
1. **Using an Arduino Nano as a PIC Programmer** (Bit-Bang Method)
2. **Using a Dedicated PIC Programmer** (like a PICkit 3 or 4)
3. **Using MPLAB X IDE and XC8 Compiler to Write the Code**  
   (Instead of Arduino IDE)

## **Step 2: Circuit Connections**
To **program** the PIC16F722 using an **Arduino Nano**, you need to connect the **In-Circuit Serial Programming (ICSP)** pins.

### **PIC16F722 to Arduino Nano Wiring (ICSP Mode)**

| **PIC16F722 Pin** | **Function**  | **Arduino Nano Pin** |
|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| Pin 1 (MCLR)     | VPP (Programming) | D8 (with 10K pull-up to 5V) |
| Pin 14 (VDD)     | Power (5V)        | 5V |
| Pin 5 (VSS)      | Ground            | GND |
| Pin 6 (PGC)      | Clock             | D9 |
| Pin 7 (PGD)      | Data              | D10 |
| Pin 21 (RB0)	   | LED 1 Output	     |	Cathode to GND, Anode via 330Î© resistor to RB0 |
| Pin 27 (ICSPDAT) | Data (Alternative) | D10 |
| Pin 28 (ICSPCLK) | Clock (Alternative) | D9 |

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Some PIC microcontrollers require **12V on MCLR** for high-voltage programming. If this is the case, you might need an external 12V circuit.

## **Step 3: Writing the LED Blink Code**
Since the **Arduino IDE does not support PIC**, you need to write the code in **MPLAB X IDE** using the **XC8 Compiler**.

### **LED Blink Code (MPLAB X - XC8 Compiler)**
```c
#include <xc.h>

// Configuration Bits (Adjust for Your Setup)
#pragma config FOSC = INTRCIO  // Internal Oscillator
#pragma config WDTE = OFF      // Watchdog Timer Disable
#pragma config PWRTE = OFF     // Power-up Timer Disable
#pragma config MCLRE = ON      // MCLR Enable
#pragma config CP = OFF        // Code Protection Off
#pragma config BOREN = OFF     // Brown-out Reset Disable

#define _XTAL_FREQ 4000000  // 4MHz Internal Oscillator

void main() {
    TRISB0 = 0;  // Set RB0 as output (LED pin)
    
    while(1) {
        RB0 = 1;  // Turn LED ON
        __delay_ms(500);
        RB0 = 0;  // Turn LED OFF
        __delay_ms(500);
    }
}
```
